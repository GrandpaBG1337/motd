# Welcome to Grandpa's Chaos Server!

**FFA fights are allowed**, but only if both players agree, kind of like a feud. If you start fights without asking first and keep doing it, you might get a temporary ban (up to 1 hour). Letâ€™s keep it fun for everyone!

## Rules:
- **No FFA** in duel zones.
- Pretending to be an admin.
- Impersonating players/admins.
- Advertising without permission.
- Excessive toxicity.
- Harassing or bullying specific users/groups.
- Racism or bigotry.
